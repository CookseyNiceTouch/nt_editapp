  "projectBrief": "Editor Brief – Nice Touch Launch Video\nTitle: Nice Touch launch Video\nTalent: Cooksey & Paul\nPrimary Use: LinkedIn + cross-posting (YouTube, site, Discord)\nLength: 1.5–2.5 minutes\n\nObjective:\nCreate a warm, confident, personal video that introduces Nice Touch to our networks. This is a \"we're doing this\" moment—more of a people-first announcement than a polished product pitch. The tone should feel informal but professional, authentic, and full of momentum.\n\nCore Message:\nNice Touch is our new venture—a set of tools designed to support creators by removing the boring, repetitive stuff that slows them down. We're calling it the \"Operating System for Creators\"—not a literal OS, but a suite of smart tools to streamline workflows. We're just getting started and inviting people to follow the journey, reach out, and get involved.\n\nTone & Style:\nConversational. Slightly playful but never goofy. Honest, collaborative, and forward-looking.\nThis should feel like two mates launching something exciting—creative, smart, and open to others joining the ride.\n\nEditing Notes:\n\nUse the best delivery of each section—we repeated a few lines and stumbled here and there, so feel free to clean it up for flow and rhythm.\n\nKeep cuts quick and natural, but don't overpolish—maintain a human, low-barrier tone.\n\nInclude name tags if needed (\"Cooksey\" / \"Paul\").\n\nAdd light music underneath if it helps carry energy, but nothing distracting.\n\nEnd with CTA options on screen:\nJoin the journey at nicetouch.app\nCome chat with us on Discord\nOr just drop us a message.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n16:9 master video"
