Editor Brief – Nice Touch Launch Video
Title: “Introducing Nice Touch”
Talent: Cooksey & Paul
Primary Use: LinkedIn + cross-posting (YouTube, site, Discord)
Length: 1.5–2.5 minutes

Objective:
Create a warm, confident, personal video that introduces Nice Touch to our networks. This is a “we’re doing this” moment—more of a people-first announcement than a polished product pitch. The tone should feel informal but professional, authentic, and full of momentum.

Core Message:
Nice Touch is our new venture—a set of tools designed to support creators by removing the boring, repetitive stuff that slows them down. We’re calling it the “Operating System for Creators”—not a literal OS, but a suite of smart tools to streamline workflows. We're just getting started and inviting people to follow the journey, reach out, and get involved.

Tone & Style:
Conversational. Slightly playful but never goofy. Honest, collaborative, and forward-looking.
This should feel like two mates launching something exciting—creative, smart, and open to others joining the ride.

Editing Notes:

Use the best delivery of each section—we repeated a few lines and stumbled here and there, so feel free to clean it up for flow and rhythm.

Keep cuts quick and natural, but don’t overpolish—maintain a human, low-barrier tone.

Include name tags if needed (“Cooksey” / “Paul”).

Add light music underneath if it helps carry energy, but nothing distracting.

End with CTA options on screen:
“Join the journey at nicetouch.app”
“Come chat with us on Discord”
“Or just drop us a message.”
