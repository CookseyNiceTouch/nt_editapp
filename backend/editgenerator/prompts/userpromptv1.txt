Hello EditAgent,

I’ve provided you with a full, frame‐accurate transcript of my footage in JSON format below. I’d like you to generate a “rough cut” plan based on my requirements.

1. **Transcript Data**  
   ```json
   {transcript_json}
My Brief

Desired Duration: Approximately {target_seconds} seconds ({target_frames} frames)

Tone/Style: {user_tone}

Content Focus: {user_focus}

Key Rules to Follow

Always choose the last take when a phrase is repeated.

Remove any pure‐silence entries from consideration.

Keep segments in roughly chronological order, but feel free to rearrange them for better storytelling.

Interleave different speakers when it enhances the narrative.

End each segment at natural phrase or sentence boundaries.

Aim to hit the target duration within a tolerance of about one sentence; perfection is not required.

Validate your own work—adjust any overlapping or out‐of‐range frame numbers rather than returning errors.

Output Requirements

Return only a JSON object (no explanations, markdown, or extra text).

The JSON must match this schema exactly:

json

{
  "file_name": "<input.file_name>",
  "fps": <input.fps>,
  "target_duration_frames": <calculated from brief>,
  "actual_duration_frames": <sum of (frame_out - frame_in)>,
  "segments": [
    {
      "segment_id": 1,
      "speaker": "<one of input.speakers>",
      "frame_in": <integer ≥ 0>,
      "frame_out": <integer ≤ duration_frames>,
      "text": "<verbatim segment text>",
      "clip_order": 1
    }
    // …additional segments…
  ]
}
Please generate the JSON rough-cut now.
